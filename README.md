# How To Build A Sustainable Businesses

This manual is an effort to document and layout an approach to building a business that raises the level of success for all stakeholders and prioritizes survival over growth or profits.

All sections may not be applicable to all businesses. For example, receiving instructions for a logistics department won't be needed in a software development firm. However, where a section is applicable, it is our best understanding of how accomplish that task or processes.

## Sustainability as our measure

There are times in any business, when it is a wiser long-term decision to take action that reduces profits or growth. In these times, you may be building for a future growth expansion, or preparing for a tough external environment. Our intent has always been to build business that are sustainable and survive over long term as a higher priority than achieving excessive levels of growth or performance. In fact, we find that whenever performance is optimzized for, survival suffers.

Beyond the survival of the firm, a sustainable business is one that ensures the survival of all stakeholders. This includes making decisions that enhance the ability for the following parties to thrive in any and all environments:

* Employees
* Suppliers
* Customers
* Investors and Lenders
* Owners
* Community Participants
* Industry Participants
* Industry Knowledge Base

We consider every business to exist within an ecosystem of businesses, communities, families, governments, industries, technologies, and other interacting forces. Every business should promote and contribute to the sustainability of all of these entities, and none at the cost of the other.

## Profits maximzation as destabilizing

Profits often come at the loss of profit for other parties in the supply chain. This raises risk of suppliers, customers, or other firms in the supply chain, endangering your ability to operate if pushed too far. As profits are taken from suppliers lets say, they have less margin to deal with downturns, quality issues, or future unforeseen events. Unable to absorb any surprise costs and customer charge-backs, a company with extremely thin margins may be at risk of bankruptcy with just one major unforeseen event.

Maximizing your profits can strip others in your supply or value chain from innovating and creating a better environment for you to thrive. Ideally you want all companies before and after you to have the ability to invest in their people, their operations, and they value propositions. This increases the total value created on the chain which you exist, and will create a more sustainable market to be part of.

A healthy supply chain will be able to absorb costs related to variation and quality. Without this ability, there is an decrease in stability of various firms in the supply chain and thus the sustainability of your business.
