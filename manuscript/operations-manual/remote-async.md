The smoother information transfer is between various business divisions, partners, and employees, the higher quality the outcomes of various decisions and tasks during the day.

In order to keep information flowing smoothly and readily available, we adhere to a policy that, as much as possible, all systems should be setup to facilitate remote, asynchronous work.

We believe that being physically together has many benefits. In fact it is our preference that all are working in on of our facilities. However, by building a communication and information system for remote and async work - it ensures that in the most chaotic times, communication will not break down.

Some of the tools that make this possible include:
* email
* slack
* trello
* knowledge base
* file sync
* collaborative documents
