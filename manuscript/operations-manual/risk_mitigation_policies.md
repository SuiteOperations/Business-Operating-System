# Risk Mitigation Policies

## Product Prequalification

Whenever delivering a product or service, there is both a pre and post delivery time frame.

The pre delivery time frame for a product may consist of

* search times
* lead times
* production times
* inspection times
* delivery and logistics times

The pre delivery time frame for a service may consist of 

* research time
* strategy time
* production & development time
* launch time

Regardless, there is an investment up front before delivery of a product or service. Any dislike or rejection of a delivered product or service will result in a restart of the pre delivery time frame activities. While this is sometimes ok, it is often not acceptable. A better practice to implement is to make sure that when delivery occurs, it will not be rejected. 

In practice, risk is lowered substantially by pushing all questions on acceptability as soon as possible, leaving a window between possible rejection and need for delivery as large as possible.

This could mean:

* submitting deliverable bullets before initiating pre delivery time frame activities
* sending samples before starting production
* agreeing on acceptance criteria before accepting an order

Below are some practices to employ depending on your deliverable and product or service status.

### Acceptance Criteria

In manufacturing you will want a full list of what your product will be measured against. The common points to consider and agree on are:
  
* Acceptable materials and element structure
* Dimensions that will measured
* Acceptable tolerances on dimensions that will be meausured
* Inspection Plan
* The number of parts that must be measured to ensure approval
* The types, templates, or categories of documents that must be submitted
* Regulatory approvals that must be obtained, either for your company, your line, or the specific product

An example of the above might be an agreement to meet an engineering print and submit the following documents:
* Customer Order for the parts, or a stocking agreement
* Bubbled Blueprint (with acceptable materials and dimensions to be measured with tolerances)
* A dimensional inspection sheet mapping measurements of 5 parts to the bubbled print

### Pre Qualification 

This one has saved numerous companies I have been involved in. If you are ordering parts for stock and distributing that part over time, then parts sit in your warehouse for weeks or months until getting delivered. This is common with distributors.

Let's assume you have a part that has a 15 week lead time to produce from your suppliers, and you have to buy 24 months at a time to get prices that make it worth you stocking. You place order 1 and get in 24 months of stock in. 18 months later, you place a new order for 24 months as you only have 6 months left of stock. It comes in within 12 weeks, ahead of schedule. You inspect it, pass it, and place it in stock. You now have 12 weeks left of the original order, plus the new lot you just received.

Normal operations use a first in, first out for inventory. This is wise and prevents stale stock and keeps the inventory up to date. In using FIFO inventory pulling, you will use up the original lot before moving to the new lot. After shipping all of the original lot, you ship the first shipment of the 2nd lot (just recieved in 12 weeks ago) and it fails at the customer.

Now you are stuck. You approved it, they are rejecting it, and they won't use it on the line. You are 15 weeks away from getting more at best and now you face weeks of shutdowns, backcharges, and a barage of customer calls, meetings, questioning, etc.

A better practice is to

* re-order parts when your stock level in terms of weeks reaches 2x your lead time for that part in weeks.
* bring all new lots to the customer for immediate qualification

The benefits of this are obvious. If the new lot fails, you still have a full standard lead time to get new parts. This gives you time to get new parts, work things out with the customer over time on the existing lot, all without shutdowns or pressure. 

This can be adapted to services and deliveries as well. By bringing concepts or drafts early to customers and working in a collaborative setting, you can find mistakes or aspects that the customer is not happy with early. You will then not have to restart the entire pre delivery time frame activities from scratch.

While a "big reveal" is attractive in concept, it is unessecarily risky for companies. 

There is no additional cost in sharing current project updates, or bringing parts over early (they will be brought over to the customer eventually anyway), but there is massive cost to waiting. The risk - reward skew here is quite large and in favor of pushing all deliveries for qualification as early as possible.
