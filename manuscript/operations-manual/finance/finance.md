## Expenses

### When an expense is an investment

Cutting expenses is good for business and opens up cash flow for improvements and opportunities. Cutting investment lowers your capability, competitiveness, and future value. It is extremely important to understand the difference.

These two are hard to differentiate for many businesses given they both show up in similar places on the income statement, under *expenses*. The difference is crucial since removing investments has a compounding negative effect on your business while removing expenses has a compounding positive improvement. Muddling the differentation even more is that fact that they can be tied together in one category, in one invoice, in one line item. 

> Company A and Z both ship products to their business customers. Their parts sit on their customer's shelves and in their customer's warehouses for weeks or even months at a time. The boxes that these parts ship in are eventually discarded when the parts are used. Spending money on the boxes is a neccessary spend in order to move the parts from supplier to customer. Their purpose is purley utilitarian. These boxes are an expense for both companies.
> Company A decides that they wish to spend a little more on their boxes. Rather than corregated brown, they purchase a two color themed box with a white base which will stand out amongst the many other boxes and bins at the customer facilities. They believe this will differentiate them from other companies, keep their name and brand top of mind to the customer and subtly improve the customer's opinion of Company A.

While Company A is simply buying a more expensive box, the reality is that there are two components to their box spend. They have an *expense* portion which is the cost of the most basic option that gets the job done correctly. However, above this, they have an *investment* portion which is used for sales and marketing. Almost all companies classify these in the same category. 

Becuase of how muddled this can get, there is often a purely analytical view of expenses that gets targeted which creates short-term improvements, while simoultaneously realizing a negative compounding effect over time.

note: this above sentence highlights a theme in this book, that poor decisions made purely on analytics can have short term positive effects while eroding your companies long term success. This is the enemy of sustainability.

When every outflow of funds is viewed as an expense, it is easy to take a "spreadsheet" approach and start optimzing, modeling *what-if scenarios*, and cutting out the waste. This view ignores strategy. Marketing strategy, business model strategy, international strategy, all of them. Many expenses are an investment.

Service is an excellent example. Customer service is a major differentiator for many local, small, or commodity type businesses. When what you are selling (or more appropriately, the outcome you are selling) can be bought elsewhere at a low search or travel cost, service is important. However, service is expensive. Service requires time and people, two of the most scarce and expensive expenses a company has. 

From an analytical view, service can be thought of as resolving a customer iqnuiry at some level relative to the customer's expectation. So the components are the

* inquiry
* resolution
* level of service

If upon a review of customer service data, you find 80% of inquiries are simple questions with the answer sitting in a database field - you can imagine a great expense reduction tactic. Automate the capture of the inquiry and resolution for all of those inquiries. You will free up 80% of your customer service labor cost while increasing time and effeciency. You can also scale customer service much easier. This the the thought behin the phone queue - "Push 4 if you want to speak to someone about travel...."

What is missed is customer service strategy. Customers call or engage in service only when there is uncertainty or a problem. Most customers never choose to engage with customer service unless neccessary. This creates an initial mood of neccessesity, a "get it over with" mentality. When this mentality hits a phone queue, there is  frustration and a rise in anxiety. You may get stuck in loops, or it doesn't find your account based on the numbers you enter. This only adds to the frustration. The negative customer reaction grows worse as you move right down the uncertainty <--> problem spectrum. I have personally switched companies that quickly and personally resolved issues or questions I had. 

Customer service needs to be, by definition and need, personal and high-touch. Not understanding this can lead to lost customers, slower growth due to retention, and overall bad satisfaction scores.

> Automation can reduce expenses, or it can reduce customers. It is important to understand the difference.

Knowing where to apply effeciency principles is a key differentiator between sustainable businesses and everyone else. Not all outflows are expenses, some are investments.
