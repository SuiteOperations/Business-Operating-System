# Employees

## Types of Employees

We have created 3 characteristics for all employees. These characteristics help set expectations and limits. We try to only set limits where neccessary, and the ones we do set have specific reasons. This said, expectations are different for different types of employees, and thus comparing can lead to some issues.

We therefore have the following characteristcis for employees

* Work
* Available
* Onsite

### Work

A *work* employee is someone who is really hired to accomplish something specific for us. Sometimes this will not have to be done at a certain time or place, but it does need to be done.

Examples might be
* software engineers
* demand planners
* sales personnel

### Available

An *available* employee is someone who needs to be available between certain hours as part of their role.

Examples might be
* phone reception
* customer service

### Onsite

An *onsite* employee is someone who needs to be onsite in order to properly accomplish their role.

Examples might be

* shipping / receiving
* facility maintainence.

These characteristics are not mutual exclusive. 

* A quality engineer is both *work* and *onsite*. They are hired to complete inspections and, due to the nature of that job, they must be done onsite. However, the timing of the those inspections do not matter.
* The CEO must be onsite to instill leadership, and is required to do certain work, but the timing is not precise and mandatory.

These characteristics may be dynamic. There are times when emergency inspections are required. For this reason you may have one quality engineer always ready during normal production hours. In this case that particular person would be *work*, *onsite*, and *available* and thus held to all three standards during that day or time period.
