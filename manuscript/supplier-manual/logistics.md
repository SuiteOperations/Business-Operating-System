### Having a supplier request a shipment to you

After suppliers are done with an order, they will often request "how they should ship" to you.

Regardless of your business, you will want to know a few pieces of information in order to set something like this up.
You should request:

* The address of the finished good
* The contact at the supplier for setting up shipment
* Incoterms of the shipment
* What the date it will be ready for pick up is
* A packing list with the following information
  * Each item being shipped by its part number
  * A description
  * Quantity for each item
  * Size of carton for each item
  * Quantity of each carton
  * How many total cartons the shipment is
  * What is the total volume (CBM is the used globally)
  * What is the total weight (KG is used globally)
