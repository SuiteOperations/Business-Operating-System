# Restructuring Operations

Operations, even the most modern, evenutally become dated. Often times a company is bought, or a new leader comes aboard and needs to "refresh" the firm, it's strategies, and its operations.

I have been involved in a few of these, what I call, restructurings. Operations can become ineffecient over time for many reasons including:

* Leaders using dated strategies
* Managers not keeping up with technology
* Becoming complacent with what is working, and riding the decline
* Industry distruptions and innovations
* Legal and regulation changes

I have seen these operation overhauls go extremely well, and extremely poorly. I have seen incredible margin expansion and sales explosions, as well as bankruptcies.

In order to help myself and you experience a more successful restructuring, I've inlcuded what I have found to be a basic checklist or procedural walkthrough.

## Understand the resources

One of the most important things that you can do when first looking to revamp a company and its operations, is to really understand its resources and its people. Restructuring is more about correct allocation of what is there, than acquisition of new resources to place. So it is crucial to review what the company has, and how it is using it.

This review process has a number of side benefits as well. The most important resource of any company is its people. Spending time with each person will allow you to find great people and potentially misplaced people, all while building trust. Most teams will not like having an outsider come in to tell them how to work at something that they may have spent decades doing before you got their. Because of this, walking and making changes day one is often not the best approach. Doing a personnel review is a great way to build understanding on the current state of the company, while also building trust with those who work there. Asking questions shows them you are looking to learn from them, and acknowledges their skills and knowledge. 

## Don't underestimate what's already being done

Another reason to hold back on changes when first showing up is hubris. Every industry is different, and every company within that industry is different. So it is crucial that you understand the small details of *why* things are done a certain way.

I cannot tell you how many times I have redesigned a process, or changed a procedure to a much more effecient or automated system - only to find out that there were small 3rd order consequences that I never thought of. 

Walking in thinking that you have the best way, without first getting to know what is being done and why, is a dangerous move.

## The goal of a restructure

For our purposes, we are going to assume that you are restructuring for 

* Higher sales
* Higher margines
* Higher productivity
* Higher cash flow
* Higher value

We can take these metrics and break them down into focal points to work on.

Take a look at the below breakdown...

We assume **Value** is **EBITDA** (or SDE) and a **multiple**...

* There are two levers for increased EBITDA:
    * Revenue, which comes down to:
        * More customers which comes from:
            * New Customers
            * New Markets
        * More $ per customer which can be seen as a result of:
            * Better availability
            * Better service
            * More Market Share
            * Better Pricing
    * Expenses, which can be reduced by 
        * Lowering current cost
            * Better bidding
            * Optimizing Inventory
        * Keeping costs steady as revenue increases (productivity)
            * Resource Allocation
            * Culture
            * Process Improvement
            * Customer Service & Satisfaction
* There are two levers for multiple expansion
    * Growth - covered above
    * Technology Enablement - 
        * Information platforms
        * Automated planning and action
        * Assisted Decision making
        * ERP / MRP systems
        * Communication Systems

Now that we have created a generalized breakdown of value encompassing all of our points including revenue, margin, and cash flow, we can create an approach to carrying this out with a current operating business.

### Generalized Restructure Approach

1. What resources do we have and how are they allocated?
    1. Get to know every single personal one by one. These insights are often the best for later on. Record everything since you wont know what to document during this phase.
        1. Who is each person (personality, desires, strength, weakness)?
        2. What does each person do?
        3. What do they use to do that?
        4. What are they frustrated with?
        5. What are they proud of?
    2. What are the financial resources and expectations?
    3. What is the asset/equipment list?
    4. What the capabilities and skills available in house?
    5. Any special relationships, directions, ideas half pursued, partners, etc?
2. Where can we re-allocate
    1. What are the real value centers for the business?
    2. Which could improve with more?
    3. Which is stressed with too much?
    4. Which don't we have that we should?
    5. What are we focusing on that we aren't good at and don't need internally?
3. Where can culture be better?
    1. Does every person feel they are cared for and matter to the company?
    2. Does the company care for the people in a legitimate way?
    3. Are they excited for excellence to hiding from community?
    4. Do they share mistakes in order to work together or hide them?
    5. Do people feel under-challenged, overworked, ignored, or suppressed?
4. Where can we streamline
    1. Are they using best practices where applicable (ex. ISO)
    2. Are there documented processes and expectations?
        1. Where can we eliminate uneeded steps which don't impact service or quality
        2. Where can we automate steps or parts of processes (like contract reviews)
    3. Is there a continuous improvement mechanism?
        1. How are ideas collected? The entire company or just a few that have input to the top?
        2. How are they vetted?
        3. Who is approached with solutions, only management or the actual users?
    4. Restructure inventory and optimize (minimize inventory $ given availability metric)
    5. Restructure bidding and optimize (minimize total cost of ownership given need metric)
    6. Restructure logistics and optimize (introduce novel distribution to customer programs to meet customer metrics while helping our own)
    7. Continually focus on customer issues/complaints, internal frustrations, things that take too long, have a poor completed percent, etc.
5. Is there a predictable sales process / pipeline?
    1. What channels work for this market?
    2. Which are we using? Which have we tried?
        1. What are the rough numbers for various pipelines?
        2. Where are the improvement opportunities?
    3. Where are the opportunities?
        1. Geographic
        2. Markets
        3. Customers
6. What can we create, reinvent, or fix?
7. What would make someone pay more to do business with us or stay with us (increase the savings needed to switch)?
    1. Reduce search and information friction
    2. Reduce communication friction
    3. Make all info available for easy decisions
    4. Innovate tools, market knowledge, inventory models, etc
    5. Other (Not being submersed in the business, I'm sure there are more)
