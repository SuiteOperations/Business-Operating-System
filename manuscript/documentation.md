## Documentation

This brings us to the third key aspect of building a sustainable business, documenation. Documenting work, decisions, and outcomes is one of those things that can have a 10x effect on your business. Some of the elements which should be documented in any business include:

* work instructions
* processes and procedures
* decisions
* exceptions
* changes
* strategies
* issues
* performance metrics
* 
### The importance of documentation

Documentation allows a business to do a number of things that an undocumented one cannot do.

* If all of your work instructions are documented, then new hires require little to no training, allowing your company to grow faster, with less mistakes, and less time / money invested per new hire.
* If you document decisions and review outcomes, you are able to isolate inputs for good decisions and strategies versus poor decisions. In turn, your strategies will become refined, your processes will increase in output, and achieve outcomes with less wasted resources.
* If you document changes youwill spend less time answering repetitive questions concerning the change, the reason, and the affected processes.
* If you document strategies you will have something to hold your people accountable to, to measure against, and to focus on.
* If you document issues, you will have a running history of every problem you incurred, what caused it, and how it was fixed. This can then be used to assist new hires with correct problem resolution without draining managers time or reproducing already made mistakes.

It is impossible to created an organizationt that continues to develop, adapt, and improve if there is no documented text on where it currently is, how it operates, and where it is going. Like DNA, proper documentation encodes the business in a way that is reviewable. Depending on what is documented, the text might give piles of data to help shift or even completely change company policies, strategies, or processes.
