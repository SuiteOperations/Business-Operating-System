## Evolutionary nature

For a thing to survive over a long period of time, it must be evolutionary. It must be able to adjust to changing external factors and environements. Biology is an excellent model here. There are mechanisms built in to adjust and adapt. Your business needs the same. This is the second key aspect of building a sustainable

Most business are based on a specific business model, and a specific target customer, and a specific sales process. Fine tuning these can explode your business in sales and popularity. However, this is not sustainability. Ask yourself, will this all still hold true 100 years from now?

If you want to build a sustainable business, you will slow your growth a bit. You won't be primed for 100% maximization of the current environment, but you will be around longer. You will need to divert some time, some money, and some resources to evolutionary processes. You will need to build the ability to adapt and change into every part of the business. 

### Revise and review

While specific processes and methods are discussed elsewhere in this manual, a general outline can be found below. You must build in regular and scheduled reviews and revisions. Some things to build in include:

1. Review and revise the organizational context.
  * Who are the stakeholders?
  * What are their needs and expectations?
  * How can each contribute to the organization?
2. Review and revise the company purpose.
  * Mission
  * Vision
  * Values
  * Culture
3. What are short and long term risks and opportunities?
4. What are the current strategies, policies, and objectives?
5. What are the critical processes that support the above? Are they achieving or should they be adjusted, changed, removed, added?
6. Review and revise resource use
  * How are resources being deployed?
  * Are they getting a return?
  * Are they being wasted?
  * Consider time, money, equipment, assets, skills, capabilities, capacity, networks, product reach, brand
7. Review firm performance (conscience capitalism)
  * Financial
  * Environmental
  * Objective achievement
  * Social good 
8. Make sure all areas of business have learning and improvement process built in.

In short, what is working, what is not, and why?
