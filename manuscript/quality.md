## Quality and excellence

Sustainability is achieved not only by focusing on the right things, but by doing the right things. Quality is to be prized over speed and cost in order to build a sustainable business.

Cost focused businesses tend to compete in low margin high volume businesses, and price themselves out of access to capital and resources needed to stay for the long term.

Speed tends to produce high-performance results that are tuned to the the current environment, but not usable once a regime shift occurs. A supply chain setup based on short term strategies like tax or tariff arbitrage, social media marketing based on optimizing for a Google search algorithm, or proudcts based on hot trends are not sustainable business practices.

When cost or speed is prioritized, you end up redoing work and reforging relationships. If we can make a decision once, build a feature once, or ship a product once, that is ultimately preferred to doing a thing three or four times. That time and investment in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th iteration could be invested into a new task or service which could build on the 1st. Rework is expensive. It is expensive because you are wasting resource redoing a thing which was already done, and it is expensive because you are not doing a thing which could compound and grow over time.

Quality is to be the focus.
