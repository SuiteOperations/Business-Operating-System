Thank you for your interest in contributing to our Open Source Manual for running a small business.

If your contribution is minor (like spelling, grammer, links, etd), please open a pull request.

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally. 
2. Connect your local to the original “upstream” repository by adding it as a remote. 
3. Pull in changes from “upstream” often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. (See more detailed instructions here.)
4. Create a branch for your edits.
5. Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your PR (for example, “Closes #37.”)
6. Include screenshots of the before and after

If this is your first pull request, check out Make a Pull Request, which @kentcdodds created as a walkthrough video tutorial.

If your contribution is major (like a new section, or page), please start by creating an issue. This way it can be discussed by the community before being implemented.
