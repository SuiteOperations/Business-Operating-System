## Service and Retention

The closer your business is to a commodity, the easier it is for both customers and employees to switch to competitors.

The truth is, most traditional businesses are not running anything proprietary. Most small and medium sized businesses are trying to do what others do, just better. Think about law offices, financial advisors, plumbing distributors, restaurant supply companies, or even a local manufacturer. Similar products create competition for your customers; similar skills create competition for your employees.

This means you need to purposefully build in retention on both sides of the field. 

As far employees are concerned, most commodity type businesses have a paradox. Turnover is high, and training can be expensive. It becomes much to expensive to train workers as turnover is high. Think of restaurants with turnover from 50% to 90%, some leaving in the first month. 

Beyond this as you train them, it increases how quickly they leave to use their new skills somewhere else. 

The answer to this can be found by providing advancement opportunities and incentives. Someone who is trained and has an opportunity to use that skill for internal advancement will stay longer. This will result in more experiences personnel. In turn, you'll have much better decisions being made at the fringe, near the customers, given the increased experience. Combine this with more fulfilled employees, and you have a service that competitors can't match; a fulfilled and 10x knowledgeable team helping customers with each and every transaction. That is compounding value. 

USHG did this in the restaurant business - a very low margin and high turnover business. Low margin, high turnover businesses can't afford to invest in employees. However, USHG has a number of restaurant, from fast casual to fine dining, which allow room for advancement. You can move up class, become a manager, co-own, or possibly even buy one of the groups restaurants. This creates an extremely high retention, happy employees, the best service in the industry, and amazing returns on investment. 

The key is to set up advancement opportunities. Beyond this, having a business model which can support this type of behavior is key. Increasing margins / employee gives you a larger amount of money for investment. Levers which help this is sales efficiency, operational efficiency, and employee productivity.
