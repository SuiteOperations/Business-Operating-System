## Hiring

## Culture
### Tailoring Culture
Each and every employee is different. While there are universals in communicating and working with people, there are also specifics.

The question that matters for each person that works for you is this: "Under what conditions does this person thrive?"

#### What conditions?
Conditions inlcude a number of aspects to their work and personal lives including
* Job Role
* Work Responsibilities
* Work Area Layout
* Control over work
* Compensation
* Benefits
* Communication Tools
* Advancement opportunities
* Learning opportunities

Some indivudals work better uninterrupted, able to focus on their work. Others thrive on social interaction. There is no right or wrong, only different people on a spectrum of choices. For example, I prefer to
* be incentived financially, and don't care about other perks
* work in the dark with a lamp on
* communicate through digital platforms (it allows me to search, re-read, and better help coworkers)

Others I work with prefer everything face to face, to have lots of paid for services, and to work in open, bright spaces.

Conditions are important to people. Individuals spend 8 or more hours a day in an environment that you control. Make it a place they can thrive!

#### Thrive?
We want people to thrive.

What do we mean? 

To be
* happy
* engaged
* fullfilled
* taken care of
* invested in

We need to remember that what creates this in you, may not create it in others. So first find out who each individual person is, and create a way for them to thrive.

Some examples for each person:
* Do they want lots of benefits and services or little help with high incentives?
* Do they work better alone or in groups?
* What drives them?
* What creates a sense of well being, contributing work or contributing to the conversation?

These questions are essentailly endless, but you get the idea.

#### Personality Tests
I find that using some tests help understand who is working with you and how you can help them thrive.

I am against using them for hiring as it creates biases and can lower diversity as you fill a company with a large number of your favorite "type". However, once hired, using them to help create an environment they can thrive in is extremely helpful!

I personally like the Gallup Clifton Strengths Finder. There are many oither great tests and quizzes though.

## Service and Retention

The closer your business is to a commodity, the easier it is for both customers and employees to switch to competitors.

The truth is, most traditional businesses are not running anything proprietary. Most small and medium sized businesses are trying to do what others do, just better. Think about law offices, financial advisors, plumbing distributors, restaurant supply companies, or even a local manufacturer. Similar products create competition for your customers; similar skills create competition for your employees.

This means you need to purposefully build in retention on both sides of the field. 

As far employees are concerned, most commodity type businesses have a paradox. Turnover is high, and training can be expensive. It becomes much to expensive to train workers as turnover is high. Think of restaurants with turnover from 50% to 90%, some leaving in the first month. 

Beyond this as you train them, it increases how quickly they leave to use their new skills somewhere else. 

The answer to this can be found by providing advancement opportunities and incentives. Someone who is trained and has an opportunity to use that skill for internal advancement will stay longer. This will result in more experiences personnel. In turn, you'll have much better decisions being made at the fringe, near the customers, given the increased experience. Combine this with more fulfilled employees, and you have a service that competitors can't match; a fulfilled and 10x knowledgeable team helping customers with each and every transaction. That is compounding value. 

USHG did this in the restaurant business - a very low margin and high turnover business. Low margin, high turnover businesses can't afford to invest in employees. However, USHG has a number of restaurant, from fast casual to fine dining, which allow room for advancement. You can move up class, become a manager, co-own, or possibly even buy one of the groups restaurants. This creates an extremely high retention, happy employees, the best service in the industry, and amazing returns on investment. 

The key is to set up advancement opportunities. Beyond this, having a business model which can support this type of behavior is key. Increasing margins / employee gives you a larger amount of money for investment. Levers which help this is sales efficiency, operational efficiency, and employee productivity.
