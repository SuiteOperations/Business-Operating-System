## Hiring

## Culture
### Tailoring Culture
Each and every employee is different. While there are universals in communicating and working with people, there are also specifics.

The question that matters for each person that works for you is this: "Under what conditions does this person thrive?"

#### What conditions?
Conditions inlcude a number of aspects to their work and personal lives including
* Job Role
* Work Responsibilities
* Work Area Layout
* Control over work
* Compensation
* Benefits
* Communication Tools
* Advancement opportunities
* Learning opportunities

Some indivudals work better uninterrupted, able to focus on their work. Others thrive on social interaction. There is no right or wrong, only different people on a spectrum of choices. For example, I prefer to
* be incentived financially, and don't care about other perks
* work in the dark with a lamp on
* communicate through digital platforms (it allows me to search, re-read, and better help coworkers)

Others I work with prefer everything face to face, to have lots of paid for services, and to work in open, bright spaces.

Conditions are important to people. Individuals spend 8 or more hours a day in an environment that you control. Make it a place they can thrive!

#### Thrive?
We want people to thrive.

What do we mean? 

To be
* happy
* engaged
* fullfilled
* taken care of
* invested in

We need to remember that what creates this in you, may not create it in others. So first find out who each individual person is, and create a way for them to thrive.

Some examples for each person:
* Do they want lots of benefits and services or little help with high incentives?
* Do they work better alone or in groups?
* What drives them?
* What creates a sense of well being, contributing work or contributing to the conversation?

These questions are essentailly endless, but you get the idea.

#### Personality Tests
I find that using some tests help understand who is working with you and how you can help them thrive.

I am against using them for hiring as it creates biases and can lower diversity as you fill a company with a large number of your favorite "type". However, once hired, using them to help create an environment they can thrive in is extremely helpful!

I personally like the Gallup Clifton Strengths Finder. There are many oither great tests and quizzes though.
