It is said that great companies nail two important aspects of their business
1. product
2. distribution

Distribution is how our customer gets our product or service.

One of the foundations to any well-run distribution service is the receiving operation. It is the procedure that sets up the rest of the product delivery service for success.

A proper receiving process will reduce the risk of
* shipping the wrong part
* shipping a bad part
* shipping late
* not being able to ship
* wrong inventory numbers

Many of the common inventory problems experienced, stem from an improper receiving process.

If your business is small, you might leave your items in a box or original shipment packaging until you need to pull an item for sale. As your business grows, or you employ help in this process (known as picking), others who do not know the product as well as you may pick the wrong item. They may not be able to find the item and thus not ship an item which is readily available. Inventory counts might be off since it is not clear from the packaging how many items are left.

All of this can be avoided with a few policies and a proper receiving procedure.

Policies to implement that save from a host of troubles mentioned here and others inlcude:
1. All packages received are processed same day
2. Nothing goes into the warehouse that can not be shiped as-is to a customer
3. All parts received are packaged in the manner they will be shipped upon being received.

These policies implicity imply a few processes such as:
* The need for a pending or rejected area. That is, goods not ready to ship out for any reason including
  * Waiting for customer approval
  * Quality defect
  * Need secondary processes
  * Require internal review
* What can and cannot be shipped to a customer is documented and known
* How parts are to be shipped is known at time of receiving and made available (whether a standard process or custom customer order)

A proper receiving process will include:
1. Inspection of shipment before delivery personnel leave the site
2. Packing List Retreival
3. Count of packages to the packing list before delivery personnel leave the site
4. Close inspection that the contents of the delivery match the packing slip in
   1. item
   2. configuration
   3. quantity
5. Quality inspection of all parts
6. Proper Information Record if this is a new part
   1. Add photo
7. Repackage of all parts
   1. Shippable container
   2. Properly labeled with neccessary information such as
      1. Part Number
      2. Lot Number
      3. Description
8. Placement in the appropriate/assigned area in the warehouse
9.  Proper system receiving in any inventory and/or accounting systems.
