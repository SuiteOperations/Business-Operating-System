# Information Management

Business activities generate data, and this data needs to be communicated to parties both internally and externally. Having proper systems that ensure recording, checking, and sharing this informaiton effeciently and accurately can mean the difference between a business that is floundering and one that is thriving.

In most small businesses, 30% - 50% of time is spent searching or communicating information. This can be drastically reduced by standardizing how this takes place. For this reason, many companies have standard processes and documents used for just the purpose.

Below are a list of documents, records, and procedures that you should consider in order to setup a streamlined operation. Documents are usually more static documents on how or why, whereas records tend to be more dynamic in recording informaiton as it is occuring. These terms are used, even as we move more and more of this to digital records and digital documents.

### Documents

* Company Vision / Mission / Values
* Company Objectives
* Plan to achieve company objectives
* Company Policies
* Company Story / Sales Talk
* Key Procedures
  * Delivering product / service
  * Producing product / service
  * Managing suppliers
  * Running warehouse
  * Invoicing / Payments
  * Sales strategies
  * Managing quality of product or service
* Work Instructions
* Employee Manual
* Supplier Manual
  
### Records

* Maintenance and Calibration of monitoring and measuring equipment
* Competence Records
* Product / Service Requirements Review Record
* Record of New Requirements for Product Service
* Design and Development Inputs Record 
* Record of Design and Development Controls

* Record of Evaluation of External Provider (Supplier)
* Record of Product/Service Characteristics
* Record of changes on customer's Property
* Record of Changes in Production/Services Provision
* Evidence of Product/Service Conformity
* Record of Nonconformity

## Dissemination

Proper access to information is essential. For this occur the following aspects should be considered:

* access
* context
* auditability
* asynch interaction
* remote viewability

When setting up on how information is captured and interacted with, consider the above above points.

### Access

You want to make sure the everyone, or at least those who may need it, have access to information. For this reason, in many companies I have been involved with, we have restricted any information being saved to desktops or hard drives. There are many tools to allow workers to share and access all information being created and analyzed across the entire company. Some of these include:

* Dropbox 
* Private Syncs like Nextcloud
* Office 365
* Google Docs
* Quip
* Trello

### Context

Having the right information is not good enough, you must have it at the right time. Understanding the contextual importance of information is key; especially in reducing search and retreival time (a huge time waste for knowledge workers).

An example might be customer specific shipping requirements. Let's assume you have 200 customers, and 6 have specific and unique instructions. You want to document this information in a way that no matter who is shipping, they will ship correctly.

You could have a document with all specific customer shipping requirements posted on the online manual. You could then have as part of the shipping instructions to reference that document before each shipping is prepped. However, this would result in wasted time for 196 customer's shipments. Shippers would most likely stop checking. 

So how do you make this information available, only when it is needed, and in a way where a new shipper will come across it? This is the importance of information context.

[One method on the above is to place the instructions on a last page of packing slips that print for those customers only. It requires custom software, but something that has proved simple and effective.

Another method we have used when digital screens are used for dashboards, is to show the instructions, or some badge next the shipment when it is loaded on the display screen in the waerhouse to be packed up. 

Basically you are looking for some trigger in the normal course of packing to either give the instructions, or point the shipper to look them up.]

### Auditability

As small companies do business in more geographic places, I have found auditability to be of growing importance. As owners, operators, engineers, and sales staff travel, there are some activities that they want to keep abreast on.

In lieu of company meetings full of updates, you can create methods by which activities and information is logged. Then, at any point, and from anywhere in the world, a person can scan the history and see all updates, data, and activities on certain issues.

* Owners can see sales activities across a spectrum of verticals
* Engineers can view software or hardware updates
* Sales staff can see updates from the quality department on inspections and product documentation

One of my favorite free-and-easy implementations of this, is a combination of Trello and Slack.

You can integrate Trello with a number of applications, using its Kanban-like system to move things like sales, quality inspections, or shipping through a pipeline. All updates then get pushed to a channel in Slack. This allows anyone traveling to scan the slack channel and be up-to-date on all activities and updates in a certain area.

There are much better ways to do this, however, that is a quick one and free method that works surprising well for small, resource-strapped companies.

### Asynch Interaction

We have found that the more information relies on synchronous communication, the more bottlenecks and hold ups there are in carrying out the many decisions needed to run a business. As teams grow, locations disperse, and time zones get involved, finding one time to share key info gets harder. This results in information being held up for days, or sharing the same thing multiple times. For this reason (and many others), you should set up asynchronous was to share information and interact.

Again, comments on Trello allow for this, and is a great free tool to use. Others include Slack, email, software with comment functionality, and intranet social networks.

### Remote Viewability

While this tends to go hand in hand with Auditability and Asynch Interaction, it is a different need. You could post post-its on peoples desks with things you need and it would be asynch info. However, with travel and dispersion growing as small companies compete in a global world, remote access to information, communication, and decisions is key.
